    <h1>UNIVERSE</h1>
    <ul><li>The universe is everything. It includes all of space, and all the matter and energy that space contains. 
        It even includes time itself and, of course, it includes you. 
        Earth and the Moon are part of the universe, as are the other planets and their many dozens of moons.</li>
        <br>
    <li>The study of universe is known as <strong><em>Cosmology</em></strong>.</li>
<br>
<li>Cosmology = cosmos<strong><em>(universe)</em></strong>+ logos<strong><em>(seience).</em></strong></li>
<br>
<li>The universe has no limit.</li></ul>
<hr>
<h3>Galaxy</h3>
<ul><li>A system of millions or billions of stars, together with gas and dust, held together by gravitational attraction.</li>
<br>
<li>There are about 100 billion galaxies in the universe, and each galaxy has on an average 100 billion stars.</li>
<br><li>The <strong>Milky Way</strong> galaxy is the home of the Earth and our solar system.It is spiral in shape.</li>
<br>
<li>Andromeda is our nearest galaxy.</li></ul>

  <h3><strong>The Big Bang Theory</strong></h3>

<img src="https://www.pmfias.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/the-big-bang-theory.jpeg">
<br>
<li>All the matter in the universe was originally a concentrated lump called primeval atom.</li>
<br>
<li>Big Bang was an explosion that occurred <strong>15 billion years ago</strong>,leading to the formation of galaxies of stars and other heavenly bodies. </li>
<br>
<li>Since then ,all the galaxies flying away from one another causing expansion of the universe.</li>
<hr>

<h3>Stars</h3>

<li>Clumps of dust and gas in a nebula come together due to gravity and form stars.</li>
<br>
<li>Stars are made of hot burning gases.</li>
<br>
<li>They emit light of their own and are very large and very hot.</li>
<br>
<li>Light takes about 4.3 years to reach us from the next nearest star <strong>proxima centauri.</strong> </li>
<hr>

<h3>The Solar System</h3>

<li>Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity -
 the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.</li>
 <br>
 <li>The sun is at the center of the solar system and all the bodies revolving around it.</li>
<br>
<li>The size of solar system has been estimated to at about 10 lakh A.U.</li>
<br>
<li>The solar system is dominated by the sun which accounts for almost 99.9% of the matter in the whole solar sysytem.</li>
<br>
<li>Mercury,Venus,Earth,Mars are called <strong>terrestrial planets</strong> and Jupiter,Staurn,Uranus and Neptune are called <strong>gaseous plantes.</strong>

    <li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has originated and found habitability</li>
<br>
<li>While Earth may not contain the largest volumes of water in the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water, extending over 70.8% of the Earth with its ocean, making Earth an ocean world.</li><br>
<li>Earth has an atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry.</li><br>
<li>Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System.</li><br>
<li>The Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes)</li>
